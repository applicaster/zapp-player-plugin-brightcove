__**About**__

The Brightcove Player is a high-performance video player that loads quickly, delivers high-quality adaptive bitrate HLS video across mobile platforms, and delivers seamless advertising and measurement capabilities.

The Brightcove Native Player SDKs are built on top of native player frameworks. This allows you to take advantage of the speed, performance, and flexibility of the native OS, and extend it into a complete video experience.

__**Key Features**__
* **VOD & LIVE HLS** - High-quality, adaptive bitrate video supporting VOD playback, live streaming, player controls, full-screen (portrait and landscape) view, and enablement of Applicaster inline player functionality.
* **Advertising** - Deliver pre-rolls, mid-rolls, and/or post-rolls to optimize your ad revenue. Ad insertion includes both VAST and VMAP support and is fully customizable on the item level. You can learn how to configure ads via the documentation [here](https://applicaster.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023208871-Configuring-Video-Ads-in-Brightcove).
* **Analytics** -  Out-of-the-box analytical insight on video performance complemented with a full integration of Applicasterâ€™s analytics plugin system so your Brightcove events will be tracked by any analytics plugins you choose. Relevant custom events can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OfAQyb6cHvmqySzdFvXfBg-f73U0VwQIPg-YKNgdvcw/edit?usp=sharing), and Brightcove's in-system reporting can be read about [here](https://www.brightcove.com/en/online-video-platform/analytics).
* **Error Handling** - For optimal user experience when the sub-optimal occurs, we've provided error screens to explain to users what happened when a video cannot play, customizable via the configuration panel to the right.
* **Closed Captions** - Enable viewing for the hearing impaired and provide the optional user experience for others. A legal requirement in some countries, and a useful feature which has been shown to [increase average viewing time](https://www.rev.com/blog/reasons-to-use-closed-caption-in-videos) and [other engagement metrics](https://www.3playmedia.com/2014/04/11/interview-tim-schmoyer-adding-captions-youtube-videos-increase-views-engagement/) as well.

__**Important Note**__
Advertising and closed captions work out-of-the-box when configured in Brightcove Videocloud and paired with the Brightcove DSP Plugin, however, these features are not dependent on using Brightcove as a CMS. As long as proper protocol is followed in the creation of feeds, other systems and DSP Plugins can be used as well. Developer documentation on this protocol for including video ads in data feeds can be found [here](https://developer.applicaster.com/player/ads-in-datasource.html), and documentation on the protocol for sending closed captions in feeds can be found [here](https://developer.applicaster.com/player/text-tracks-from-dsp.html).
